# ✅ Testing Checklist - Security Implementation

## 🎯 Final Verification Steps

Now that the deployment is working, let's test all the security features to make sure everything is properly secured.

---

## Test 1: Owner Login ✅

**What to test:** Owner can login with security answer

**Steps:**
1. Go to: `https://seu-site.vercel.app/login.html`
2. Enter:
   - Email: `sandrosandri.bysousa@gmail.com`
   - Password: (your password)
   - Security Answer: `10.09.2025`
3. Click "Login"

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Login successful
- ✅ Redirected to homepage or profile
- ✅ You see "Logged In" in the header

**If it fails:**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set in Vercel

---

## Test 2: Regular User Login ✅

**What to test:** Regular users can login

**Steps:**
1. Go to: `https://seu-site.vercel.app/login.html`
2. Enter credentials of a regular user account
3. Click "Login"

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Login successful
- ✅ No security answer required

**If it fails:**
- Check if user exists
- Check browser console for errors

---

## Test 3: Admin Page Protection ✅

**What to test:** Admin page is protected (can't access without login)

**Steps:**
1. **Make sure you're logged out** (or use incognito/private window)
2. Try to access: `https://seu-site.vercel.app/admin.html`
3. Or try: `https://seu-site.vercel.app/api/admin?endpoint=customers`

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Redirected to login page, OR
- ✅ Shows error 401/403 Unauthorized
- ✅ **DOES NOT** show customer data

**If it fails:**
- Admin page should be protected - if you can see it without login, there's a security issue

---

## Test 4: Admin Access (When Logged In) ✅

**What to test:** Owner can access admin when logged in

**Steps:**
1. Login as owner (Test 1)
2. Go to: `https://seu-site.vercel.app/admin.html`
3. Try to view customer data

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Admin page loads
- ✅ Customer table shows data
- ✅ **NO passwords visible** in the table
- ✅ Commerce mode controls work

**If it fails:**
- Check browser console
- Verify you're logged in as owner

---

## Test 5: Commerce Mode Protection ✅

**What to test:** Only owner can change commerce mode

**Steps:**
1. Login as owner
2. Go to admin page
3. Try to change commerce mode (LIVE/WAITLIST/EARLY_ACCESS)
4. Logout
5. Try to change commerce mode via API directly (use browser console or Postman)

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Owner can change mode (in admin page)
- ✅ Non-owner gets 403 error when trying via API

**If it fails:**
- Commerce mode should be protected - verify API returns 403 for non-owners

---

## Test 6: Customer Data Security ✅

**What to test:** Passwords are not exposed

**Steps:**
1. Login as owner
2. Go to admin page
3. View customer table
4. Click "View Details" on any customer
5. Export to CSV

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ **NO password column** in the table
- ✅ **NO password** in customer details modal
- ✅ **NO password** in CSV export

**If it fails:**
- This is a critical security issue - passwords should never be visible

---

## Test 7: API Endpoints Protection ✅

**What to test:** Admin APIs require authentication

**Steps:**
1. **Without being logged in**, open browser console (F12)
2. Try to fetch: `fetch('https://seu-site.vercel.app/api/admin?endpoint=customers')`
3. Check the response

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Returns 401 or 403 error
- ✅ **DOES NOT** return customer data

**If it fails:**
- This is a critical security issue - API should be protected

---

## Test 8: Delete Customer Protection ✅

**What to test:** Only owner can delete customers

**Steps:**
1. Login as owner
2. Go to admin page
3. Try to delete a customer (use a test account, not real data!)
4. Logout
5. Try to delete via API: `fetch('https://seu-site.vercel.app/api/admin?endpoint=customers&email=test@test.com', {method: 'DELETE'})`

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Owner can delete (with confirmation)
- ✅ Non-owner gets 403 error

**If it fails:**
- Delete should be protected - verify API returns 403

---

## Test 9: Site Functionality ✅

**What to test:** Regular site features still work

**Steps:**
1. Browse products
2. Add to cart
3. View collection
4. Check favorites (if logged in)

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ All features work normally
- ✅ No errors in console
- ✅ Site feels fast and responsive

**If it fails:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API routes are working

---

## Test 10: JWT Token Expiration ✅

**What to test:** Tokens expire after 24 hours (optional - hard to test immediately)

**Steps:**
1. Login
2. Wait 24 hours (or modify token expiration for testing)
3. Try to access admin page

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ After expiration, user needs to login again

**Note:** This is hard to test immediately, but the system is configured for 24-hour expiration.
